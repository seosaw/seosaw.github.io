# Protocols

SEOSAW has developed a set of linked protocols to study the complex socio-ecology of African woodlands. These protocols were designed to allow for data collected across the region to be compared, whilst retaining flexibility to suit many different objectives. Please reach out to us if you have questions about the protocols.  We can also assist you in preparing methods and datasheets for your project.

# Field Resources

[Field Cheat Sheet](https://bitbucket.org/miombo/seosaw/raw/master/doc/manuals/cheat_sheet/versions/cheat_sheet_latest.pdf) - This one-page sheet is a printer-friendly summary of the SEOSAW codes and tips for best practice when sampling stems.  

[Equipment List](https://bitbucket.org/miombo/seosaw/raw/master/doc/manuals/equipment_list/equipment_list_Oct2021.xlsx) - Use this list of recommended equipment to help you plan for your fieldwork!  

Digital forms - We use KoboToolbox to host digital data entry forms for use on Android devices. [Follow these instructions](https://bitbucket.org/miombo/seosaw/raw/master/doc/forms/odk/filling_forms.txt) to get setup with your Android device. Remember to consult the [SEOSAW plot design and stem measurements manual][1] before collecting data. Form templates for most protocols can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/miombo/seosaw/raw/master/doc/forms/odk/forms/forms.zip).

## Goals of SEOSAW protocols and datasheets  

* Not to suggest novel methods, but to borrow from elsewhere, and present methods that have been tried and tested by the partners in tropical savannas and woodlands.
* To share experience about what works and what does not, to avoid mistakes being repeated.
* To allow data to be collected in a way that makes it easy to integrate with others in the SEOSAW network, and gives confidence is comparisons across the network.
* To make the SEOSAW network as comparable as possible with other regional networks in the wet tropics such as [AfriTRON](http://www.afritron.org), and with other savanna and dry forest plot networks.
* To provide guidance on the minimum set of measurements to achieve integration within SEOSAW, but not to preclude many other measurements. 
* The methods are also designed to be compatible with the data in [ForestPlots.net](https://www.forestplots.net) (although they are not as exhaustive) to allow the use of the ForestPlots.net data infrastructure and associated analysis tools.
* To minimise effort by reducing the need to document methods (if they are in line with the protocol). I.e. you should be able to say "we followed the SEOSAW protocol version x").
* To minimise effort by allowing the use of the SEOSAW data tables, code, database, and tablets for data collection, and the use of ForestPlots.net for long term, secure storage.
* To suggest methods aimed at long term permanent plots that are to be remeasured approximately every 2-5 years to study changes in ecosystem structure, diversity, carbon storage, mortality and growth.
